  "short_description": "Last Orders is a student written show that was first put on at University of Warwick via Freshblood New Writing Society. Since the success of the first sold out run, we have made a few tweaks and refinements to take this magnificent show to Edinburgh Fringe! A brilliant opportunity for all involved with some first time Fringe goers.\r\n\r\nOur show follows Kenneth's first day working at the McGonagall Tavern, though as we are introduced to witches, a couple rats, the uptight manager, the creative yet unstable chef and the critic. Well, we are in for a ride.",
