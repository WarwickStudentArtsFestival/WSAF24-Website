Most people use language each day without contemplating what theyâ€™ve done, Writing Society offers you a space, not only to continue to manoeuvre the language choices that you make, but to understand why you make them.\r\n\r\nBy writing fiction, poetry, scripts, and plays you can explore how to manipulate language in a meaningful way- all alongside people who share your passion!",
