  "short_description": "Chicken Soup with Barley is a 1956 play by Arnold Wesker that grapples with the breakdown of an ideology and a family in parallel, synthesising the personal, political, and philosophical into an odyssey across decades that reveals the power of brotherhood even in a country that always seems in decline. Our production would modernise the text and give it a queer edge to explore the prescience of community and caring in the modern age.",
