  "short_description": "An artistic masterpiece depicting our well loved flatmate Daiki, of whom has been residing with us for almost a year. He will only be with us for a few more weeks, but his effect on Warwick University life will be felt for generations to come. No man who has been graced by his presence will be left without a smile, and this artform exists to immortalise and encapsulate only a fraction of his glory.",
