The society welcomes all brass players, percussionists and even those who have never picked up a brass instrument before! Our award winning ensembles (which include a brass band, a symphonic brass ensemble and a beginners brass group) welcome all standards of musicians, and (apart from symphonic brass) are all non-auditioned. With over 50 members, we provide opportunities for all brass players to rehearse, perform and socialise regularly.",
