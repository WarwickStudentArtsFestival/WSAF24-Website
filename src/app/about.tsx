      <h2>What is WSAF?</h2>
      <p>
        Warwick Student Arts Festival (WSAF) is a 3 day showcase and celebration
        of all aspects of the arts here at Warwick!
      </p>
      <p>
        Every day will feature a programme of events including theatre, dance,
        music, film, literature, comedy and art held across the entirety of
        campus.
      </p>
      <p>
        Performances will run throughout the day, so there will be things to see
        and do from the morning until the evening.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have a show, some art, a dance, a poem or anything in between
        that you want to show, take part!
